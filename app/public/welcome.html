    <p>
      Welcome to Freaktures, where you can get your very own freaky-creatures to train and grow. 
      You can randomize a Freakture every two minutes. Remember you can only have one at a time, 
      so saving another Freakture gets rid of your old one!
    </p>
    <p>
      Freaktures can come in many different shapes and sizes, with different sprites, mutations, 
      types, stats, moves and rarities. There are 7 different rarities you can get: Common, Uncommon, 
      Rare, Epic, Mythical, Divine, and The One and Only. They have a chance to improve their rarity 
      as they level up though, so don't give up on one that starts out low! 
    </p>
    <p>
      A Freakture can have up to four moves, unlocking each every 20 levels. The higher the rarity, the better chances for stronger moves. 
      Once they have a full moveset, every five levels gives you a reroll, which allows you to change one of your moves.
    </p>
    <p>
      To level up your Freakture, just press the +1 XP button on the trainer tab. Additionally, you 
      can also stack up passive XP every dayâ€”just remember to collect it before it's full to avoid 
      wasting them!
    </p>
    <p>
      Remember to upload your own picture and check out the leaderboard to compare your Freakture 
      with other users! Later in a future update, get ready to face them head to head in battle mode!
    </p>

      Thank you for playing! <br>
